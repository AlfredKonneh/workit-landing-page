## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Here are some key things I learned while working on this project:

Improved my understanding of responsive design by using media queries to adjust the layout based on screen size.
Enhanced my CSS skills, particularly with Flexbox and Grid for aligning elements.
Practiced adding hover and focus states for interactive elements to improve user experience.
Here's a sample of code that I found particularly useful:

```css
header {
  position: relative;
  padding: 3.2rem 4.4rem 14rem;
  height: auto;
  background-image: url('./starter-code/assets/images/bg-pattern-1.svg'),
    url('./starter-code/assets/images/bg-pattern-2.svg');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: -20% 80%, 110% 90%;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to:

Explore more advanced CSS layout techniques like CSS clipping paths and shape-outside for complex designs.
